### Overview
--
Propane is a Java framework to manage your configurations for different contexts. 
- Annotate your Java classes with configuration management annotations. 
- Define your configurations for each context for a particular application. 

and then the Propane enables the configuration set for a given context.
 
A context may be region, environment, or a custom context defined by you. For instance, if your service is running in the US region and in the development environment, Propane enables the configurations for the US region and the development environment.

## Usage

Since the project is under development, you are able to test it by cloning the project on your computer and build it. 

```
git clone git@github.com:bagdemir/propane.git
cd propane
mvn -e clean install```

After you install propane in your local Maven repository, you can add it into your project by defining the dependency and test it:

```   
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.moo</groupId>
 <artifactId>propane</artifactId>
 <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
