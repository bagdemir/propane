Propane is a light-weight Java framework for Configuration Management that 
intend to take advantage of structured data serialization format, YAML, by 
providing configurations context-awareness.  
 
Propane is inspired by the Netflix's Archaius project with some cool new 
features like annotation based configuration entities, custom context 
definitions and so on. If Archaius works for you, probably, you would keep it.
 If you make some considerations on managing your configurations throughout 
 your new applications from the scratch, Propane might be the right solution for
  you.

## Overview

##

Propane is a Java framework to manage your configurations for different contexts. 
- Create YAML configuration files.
- Annotate your Java classes with configuration management annotations. 

and then  Propane enables the configuration set in applications for this given context.
 
A context may be a region, an environment, or a custom context just defined by you. For instance, if your service is running in the US region and in the dev environment, Propane enables the configurations for Development + US in those applications running in US and dev environment.

## Usage

##

Since the project is under development, you are able to test it by cloning the project on your computer and build it. 

<pre lang="shell">
git clone git@github.com:bagdemir/propane.git
cd propane
mvn -e clean install
</pre>

After you install propane in your local Maven repository, you can add it into your project by defining the dependency and test it:

```
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.moo</groupId>
 <artifactId>propane</artifactId>
 <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

Now, you can create the configuration entities: 

<pre lang="java">
@Configuration(componentId = "test")
@Source(url = "classpath://configurations/test.properties")
public class TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource {

  @KeyValue(name = "testProp")
  private String url;

  @KeyValue(name = "longProp")
  private Long timeout;

  @KeyValue(name = "intProp")
  private int count;

  private String nonPropField;

}
</pre>

You can now register your entity witin the configuration manager:
<pre lang="java">
    final ContextInfo contextInfo = ContextInfo.of("EU", "STAGE");
    final ConfigurationManager configurationManager = ConfigurationManager
            .newManager(Optional.of(contextInfo));
    configurationManager.register(TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource.class);
</pre>

Once the configurations are loaded by the ConfigurationManager, you can access them:

<pre lang="java">
final Optional<TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource> configs = configurationManager.load(TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource.class);
final TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource testPropsWithClasspathSource = configs.get();
testPropsWithClasspathSource.getUrl()
</pre>

That's all.
