### Overview
--
Propane is a Java framework to manage your configurations for different contexts. 
- Annotate your Java classes with configuration management annotations. 
- Define your configurations for each context for a particular application. 

and then  Propane enables the configuration set in applications for this given context.
 
A context may be a region, an environment, or a custom context just defined by you. For instance, if your service is running in the US region and in the dev environment, Propane enables the configurations for Development + US in those applications running in US and dev environment.

## Usage

Since the project is under development, you are able to test it by cloning the project on your computer and build it. 

<pre lang="shell">
git clone git@github.com:bagdemir/propane.git
cd propane
mvn -e clean install
</pre>

After you install propane in your local Maven repository, you can add it into your project by defining the dependency and test it:

<pre>
<dependency>
 <groupId>io.moo</groupId>
 <artifactId>propane</artifactId>
 <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
</pre>

Now, you can create the configuration entities: 

<pre lang="java">
@Configuration(componentId = "test")
@Source(url = "classpath://configurations/test.properties")
public class TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource {

  @KeyValue(name = "testProp")
  private String url;

  @KeyValue(name = "longProp")
  private Long timeout;

  @KeyValue(name = "intProp")
  private int count;

  private String nonPropField;

}
</pre>

You can now register your entity witin the configuration manager:
<pre lang="java">
final ConfigurationManager configurationManager = new ConfigurationManagerImpl();
configurationManager.register(TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource.class);
</pre>

Once the configurations are loaded by the ConfigurationManager, you can access them:

<pre lang="java">
final Optional<TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource> configs = configurationManager.load(TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource.class);
final TestConfigurationEntityWithClasspathSource testPropsWithClasspathSource = configs.get();
testPropsWithClasspathSource.getUrl()
</pre>

That's all.
